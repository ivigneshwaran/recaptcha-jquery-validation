#recaptcha-jquery-validation

Its just like a boiler plate for google recaptcha validation by jQuery validation plugin on both Front-end and Back-end
Used JS for front-end (vaildation.js) and php for back-end (mail.php).
& used phpMailer library for mail fucntion.
Alot of Jquery validation manipulations are available on val folder.
Thank you.
